Golang homemate scene
=====================

First thanks to @insertjokehere to help me to understand the last part of how to decrypt the network trafic between the Homemate application and the aws server.

This is a POC to test the way to trigger a scene that has been configured in the homemate application (and it works for me).


# Why ?

Because i want to control my AC based on the outside temperature (like if temp outside is greater than -15 use the AC else use the heater).

# How it works
